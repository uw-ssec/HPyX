## Project Overview

HPyX provides Python bindings for the HPX C++ Parallelism Library using Nanobind
and leveraging Python 3.13's free-threading capabilities. This project aims to make
HPX's powerful parallel processing features accessible to Python developers
while achieving optimal performance through true multi-threading.

**Status**: HPyX is currently in active development as part of a research project
at the University of Washington's Scientific Software Engineering Center (SSEC).
The project is experimental and APIs may change as we explore optimal integration
patterns between Python's free-threading mode and HPX's parallel execution model.

## What is HPX?

HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and
Parallelism that implements modern C++ parallelism features defined by the C++
Standard. It provides:

- A unified API for local and remote parallel operations
- Asynchronous execution through futures and dataflow
- Fine-grained task parallelism
- Support for distributed computing
- Performance counter frameworks for runtime adaptivity

## Features

- **Python Interface**: Clean Python API for HPX's parallel algorithms and components
- **True Parallel Execution**: Leverages Python 3.13's experimental free-threading mode
- **High-Performance Bindings**: Uses Nanobind for minimal-overhead C++ integration
- **Pythonic Design**: APIs that follow Python conventions while exposing HPX capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated testing and benchmarking framework
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Builds consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Current Development Focus

- Core HPX binding infrastructure
- Python 3.13 free-threading compatibility
- Parallel algorithm implementations
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- API design and developer experience

## Installation and Building

**Note**: HPyX is currently in active development. Pre-built packages are not yet
available. Installation requires building from source using the provided build system.

HPyX uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for environment and dependency management,
which provides reproducible builds and handles complex C++ dependencies automatically.

### Prerequisites

- Install pixi following the instructions on the
  [pixi documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/install/)
- Python 3.13 built with `--disable-gil` option for optimal performance
- Modern C++ compiler with C++17 support (GCC 8+, Clang 8+, MSVC 2019+)

### Setting up the environment

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uw-ssec/HPyX.git
cd HPyX
```

HPyX provides several predefined environments:

- `py313t` - Python 3.13 with free threading for testing
- `py313` - Standard Python 3.13 environment for testing
- `build313t` - Environment for building with Python 3.13 free threading

To create and activate an environment:

```bash
pixi shell -e py313
```

### Installing the package

To install the package in development mode with all optional dependencies:

```bash
pixi run install-all
```

For a standard installation:

```bash
pixi run install
```

To uninstall the package:

```bash
pixi run uninstall
```

### Building the package

To build a wheel:

```bash
pixi run build-wheel
```

### Running tests

To run tests:

```bash
pixi run test
```

### Code quality

To run linting on all files:

```bash
pixi run lint
```

### Additional tasks

Check the Python version in your environment:

```bash
pixi run get-python-version
```

## Development

HPyX uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for reproducible development environments and
dependency management. This approach ensures consistent builds across different
platforms and simplifies the complex build process for HPX and its dependencies.

### Development Environment

HPyX provides several predefined environments optimized for different use cases:

- `py313t` - Python 3.13 with free threading for testing and development
- `py313` - Standard Python 3.13 environment for compatibility testing
- `build313t` - Environment for building with Python 3.13 free threading
- `docs` - Environment for documentation development with MkDocs
- `linting` - Environment for code quality checks and pre-commit hooks

### Build Process

The build system integrates several complex components:

1. **HPX C++ Library**: Built from source using git submodules for optimal performance
2. **Nanobind Integration**: Efficient Python-C++ bindings with minimal overhead
3. **Free-Threading Support**: Optimizations for Python 3.13's experimental free-threading mode
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Technical Approach

Our development approach consists of:

1. **Core Binding Layer**: Low-level bindings for HPX C++ core functionality using Nanobind
2. **High-Level Python API**: A Pythonic interface that wraps the core bindings
3. **Free-Threading Integration**: Mechanisms to ensure the bindings work optimally with Python's free-threading mode
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Performance benchmarks and functionality tests to verify behavior
