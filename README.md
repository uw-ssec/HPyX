## Project Overview

HPyX provides Python bindings for the HPX C++ Parallelism Library using Nanobind
and leveraging Python 3.13's free-threading capabilities. The goal is to make
HPX's powerful parallel processing features accessible to Python developers
while achieving optimal performance through true multi-threading.

## What is HPX?

HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and
Parallelism that implements modern C++ parallelism features defined by the C++
Standard. It provides:

- A unified API for local and remote parallel operations
- Asynchronous execution through futures and dataflow
- Fine-grained task parallelism
- Support for distributed computing
- Performance counter frameworks for runtime adaptivity

## Features

- Python interface to HPX's parallel algorithms and components
- True parallel execution using Python 3.13's free-threading mode (experimental)
- High-performance bindings using Nanobind
- Pythonic API that follows Python conventions while exposing HPX power
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Installation and Building

HPyX uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for environment and dependency management.
This allows for consistent development environments across platforms.

### Prerequisites

- Install pixi following the instructions on the
  [pixi documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/install/)
- Python 3.13 built with `--disable-gil` option for optimal performance
- Modern C++ compiler with C++17 support (GCC 8+, Clang 8+, MSVC 2019+)

### Setting up the environment

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uw-ssec/HPyX.git
cd HPyX
```

HPyX provides several predefined environments:

- `py313t` - Python 3.13 with free threading for testing
- `py313` - Standard Python 3.13 environment for testing
- `build313t` - Environment for building with Python 3.13 free threading

To create and activate an environment:

```bash
pixi shell -e py313
```

### Installing the package

To install the package in development mode with all optional dependencies:

```bash
pixi run install-all
```

For a standard installation:

```bash
pixi run install
```

To uninstall the package:

```bash
pixi run uninstall
```

### Building the package

To build a wheel:

```bash
pixi run build-wheel
```

### Running tests

To run tests:

```bash
pixi run test
```

### Code quality

To run linting on all files:

```bash
pixi run lint
```

### Additional tasks

Check the Python version in your environment:

```bash
pixi run get-python-version
```

## Development

HPyX uses Nanobind to create efficient Python bindings for the HPX C++ library.
The build system is based on CMake and scikit-build-core for seamless
integration between C++ and Python components.

### Technical Approach

Our approach consists of the following components:

1. **Core Binding Layer**: Low-level bindings for HPX C++ core functionality
   using Nanobind
2. **High-Level Python API**: A Pythonic interface that wraps the core bindings
3. **Free-Threading Integration**: Mechanisms to ensure the bindings work
   optimally with Python's free-threading mode
4. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive tests to verify functionality and
   performance
